# Penetration Testing Methodology

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the penetration testing methodology followed for the **Web Application Penetration Testing Project**. The test uses the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)** as the primary framework, with integrated testing guidelines from the **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**. The objective of the penetration test is to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, providing remediation suggestions for each finding.

## 2. Phases of the Penetration Test

### 2.1 Intelligence Gathering (Reconnaissance)
- **Objective**: Collect detailed information about the target to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Tools**: 
   - **Nmap**: Network discovery, open ports.
   - **Whois**: Identify domain registration info.
   - **Shodan**: Identify exposed services.
- **Activities**:
   - Discover subdomains, server locations, technology stack, and services.
   - Identify domain, IP addresses, and any publicly available data.
   - Review for any sensitive information that could aid in further testing.
- **Deliverables**: 
   - List of discovered assets.
   - Technologies and software versions used.
   - Identified subdomains and open ports.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Scanning & Enumeration)
- **Objective**: Identify potential vulnerabilities within the target environment.
- **Tools**: 
   - **Nikto**: Web server scanning.
   - **Burp Suite**: Proxy tool for web application scanning.
   - **Dirb/Gobuster**: Directory and file brute forcing.
- **Activities**:
   - Perform a comprehensive scan for known vulnerabilities.
   - Analyze the results of each vulnerability scan and identify critical flaws.
   - Manually verify vulnerabilities (e.g., HTTP headers, open ports, outdated software).
- **Deliverables**:
   - Detailed vulnerability list (including CVEs, if applicable).
   - Exposed services and any potential entry points.

### 2.3 Exploitation
- **Objective**: Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control of the system.
- **Tools**: 
   - **SQLmap**: Automates the exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
   - **Metasploit**: Exploits known vulnerabilities and provides custom payloads.
   - **Custom Scripts**: Tailored scripts for specific attack vectors.
- **Activities**:
   - Exploit **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities, focusing on those that offer the greatest risk (e.g., Broken Access Control, SQL Injection).
   - Bypass authentication mechanisms and escalate privileges where possible.
   - Exploit and test for flaws like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and more.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Proof-of-concept exploits and screenshots.
   - Detailed records of successful exploitation and compromised data.

### 2.4 Post-Exploitation
- **Objective**: Assess the consequences of exploitation and gather further information.
- **Tools**:
   - **Mimikatz**: For credential extraction on compromised systems.
   - **Hashcat**: Cracking extracted passwords.
- **Activities**:
   - Assess data exposure, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
   - Investigate how deep the access goes, and whether it can be maintained (backdoors, etc.).
   - Extract valuable data and assess its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Summary of data exposure and the extent of privilege escalation.
   - Recommendations for mitigating persistent threats.

### 2.5 Reporting & Remediation
- **Objective**: Document findings and provide clear remediation steps.
- **Activities**:
   - Create a final penetration test report, detailing identified vulnerabilities, exploitation results, and their impact.
   - Provide actionable remediation steps for each finding to mitigate risks.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Final **Pentest Report**.
   - **Vulnerability Findings Summary** with associated CVE numbers and fixes.
   - **Remediation Guide** to secure the system and patch vulnerabilities.

## 3. Integration of OWASP WSTG
The **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)** provides a thorough framework for web application security testing. We integrated WSTG's testing methodology into our process, particularly in phases like **Vulnerability Analysis** and **Exploitation**. Key areas from WSTG that guide our testing include:
- **Authentication Testing**
- **Session Management Testing**
- **Input Validation Testing**
- **Authorization and Access Control Testing**
These guidelines ensure that we cover all the critical areas of web application security during the testing process.

## 4. Tools and Resources
### Tools Used:
- **Nmap**: For discovering open ports and services.
- **Burp Suite**: For interception and analysis of HTTP traffic.
- **SQLmap**: For automating SQL injection attacks.
- **Metasploit**: For launching various exploits against known vulnerabilities.
- **Mimikatz**: For extracting credentials from a compromised system.

### Resources:
- **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide**: [OWASP WSTG](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**: [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)

## 5. Ethical Guidelines and Legal Considerations
Penetration testing should always be conducted in an ethical manner with full authorization from the target system owner. The testing must comply with the laws and regulations of the country or region in which it is conducted. Unauthorized testing can result in legal consequences.

## 6. Conclusion
The structured approach provided by PTES and OWASP WSTG ensures a thorough and effective penetration testing process. By following these phases, we can identify security vulnerabilities, demonstrate their potential impact, and provide practical remediation steps to improve the overall security of the web application.
