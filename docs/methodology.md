# Penetration Testing Methodology

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the penetration testing methodology followed for the **Web Application Penetration Testing Project**. The test uses the **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)** as the framework. The objective of the penetration test is to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities, providing remediation suggestions for each finding.

This penetration test is conducted on a **local instance** of the **OWASP Juice Shop** web application, which is intentionally vulnerable and designed for educational purposes. All testing activities are confined to this local environment, ensuring that no real systems or applications are affected.

**Note:** This testing is for **educational purposes only** and performed in a safe, isolated, and authorized environment.

## 2. Phases of the Penetration Test (OWASP WSTG)

### 2.1 Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)
- **Objective**: Collect detailed information about the target to identify potential attack vectors.
- **Tools**: 
   - **Nmap**: Network discovery, open ports.
   - **Whois**: Identify domain registration info.
   - **Shodan**: Identify exposed services.
   - **Google Dorking**: Identify exposed sensitive data.
- **Activities**:
   - Discover subdomains, IP addresses, and any publicly available information.
   - Gather metadata related to the target's web servers, application components, and network infrastructure.
   - Identify publicly available services, APIs, and potential attack vectors.
   - Use **WSTG-INFO** guidelines to check for exposed information about the technologies used, server configurations, etc.
- **Deliverables**: 
   - List of discovered assets and services.
   - Technologies and software versions used.
   - Identified subdomains and open ports.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Identification (Scanning & Security Testing)
- **Objective**: Identify vulnerabilities within the web application by testing common attack vectors.
- **Tools**: 
   - **OWASP ZAP**: Automated scanner for web application vulnerabilities.
   - **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner for identifying security flaws.
   - **Nikto**: Web server scanner for finding known vulnerabilities.
   - **Wget**: To download a website recursively, to download a file.
- **Activities**:
   - Perform automated vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Broken Access Control**, etc.
   - Use **WSTG-APP** guidelines to test areas like authentication, session management, and input validation.
   - Conduct manual testing and verification to reduce false positives and identify critical vulnerabilities.
   - Test for vulnerabilities listed in the **OWASP Top 10**, with a focus on application-level vulnerabilities like **Injection**, **Broken Authentication**, and **Sensitive Data Exposure**.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Comprehensive list of discovered vulnerabilities.
   - Risk assessment of vulnerabilities based on severity.

### 2.3 Exploiting Vulnerabilities (Proof of Concept)
- **Objective**: Test identified vulnerabilities to confirm their exploitability.
- **Tools**: 
   - **Burp Suite**: To manipulate and exploit input points.
   - **Python Scripts**: To automate the exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
   - **OWASP ZAP**: To verify common vulnerabilities.
- **Activities**:
   - Verify if critical vulnerabilities, such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Broken Access Control**, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data.
   - Conduct manual tests to exploit issues like weak authentication mechanisms, poor session management, and insecure direct object references.
   - Demonstrate the impact of the vulnerabilities through **proof-of-concept** attacks or by retrieving sensitive data.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Proof-of-concept exploits, demonstrating the impact of vulnerabilities.
   - Exploited vulnerabilities that have been confirmed as an attack vector (e.g., screenshots, logs).

### 2.4 Reporting & Remediation
- **Objective**: Document findings, explain the impact of vulnerabilities, and provide remediation steps.
- **Activities**:
   - Write a detailed penetration testing report based on the **WSTG** methodology, including findings, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors.
   - Provide actionable remediation steps for each vulnerability, focusing on best practices as outlined in **WSTG-APP**.
   - Include a risk assessment for each vulnerability to help prioritize remediation efforts.
   - Include general recommendations on securing web applications, such as improving input validation, strengthening authentication mechanisms, and addressing server misconfigurations.
- **Deliverables**:
   - Final **Penetration Test Report**, including a detailed analysis of vulnerabilities found.
   - **Vulnerability Findings Summary**, listing each vulnerability with its severity and risk.
   - **Remediation Guide**, detailing steps to mitigate risks and secure the application.

## 5. Ethical Guidelines and Legal Considerations
Since this project involves testing a local instance of the OWASP Juice Shop, ethical and legal considerations are minimal. However, in any real-world penetration testing scenario, ensure proper authorization is obtained, and all testing is done within legal boundaries to avoid unauthorized access to systems.

## 6. Conclusion
The structured approach provided by **OWASP WSTG** ensures a thorough and effective penetration testing process. By following these phases, we can identify security vulnerabilities, demonstrate their potential impact, and provide practical remediation steps to improve the overall security of the web application. This methodology not only ensures comprehensive security testing but also enhances our understanding of web application security, which is crucial for both educational purposes and real-world applications.
