## Example Vulnerability Report

### Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection

- **Vulnerability**: SQL Injection in the login form.
- **Description**: The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The user input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Severity**: High
- **CVEs**: CVE-2021-12345
- **Affected Components**: Login page, database authentication system.
- **Exploitability**: Easy – Any unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Impact**: The attacker can bypass authentication and access sensitive user data, potentially gaining administrative privileges.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Screenshot of the SQL injection payload used to bypass authentication.
- **Remediation**: 
  - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  - Validate and sanitize user input, especially for fields that interact with the database.

### Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Vulnerability**: Reflected XSS in the search functionality.
- **Description**: The search form does not sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be reflected back on the page and executed in the victim's browser.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **CVEs**: CVE-2020-6789
- **Affected Components**: Search functionality on the homepage.
- **Exploitability**: Moderate – The attacker must trick the user into clicking a crafted search URL.
- **Impact**: The attacker can steal session cookies or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Example of the malicious payload injected into the search form.
- **Remediation**: 
  - Sanitize user inputs and encode special characters.
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to limit the execution of unauthorized scripts.
