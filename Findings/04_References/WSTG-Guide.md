## WSTG-CLNT-01: Client-Side Testing

Client-side testing focuses on assessing the security of the client-side code and its interaction with the server. This includes testing for issues such as cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure cookies, improper storage of sensitive data, and other client-side vulnerabilities.

### Key Areas:
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure cookies and session handling
- HTML5 storage vulnerabilities
- JavaScript security issues

### Mitigations:
- Use secure coding practices, such as input validation and encoding.
- Apply proper session management techniques (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags for cookies).
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

---

## WSTG-INPT-01: Input Validation Testing

Input validation is critical to preventing injection attacks (such as SQL injection or Command injection) and other malicious exploits. This section focuses on testing the application's input validation mechanisms.

### Key Areas:
- Validation of all user inputs (URLs, headers, form data, etc.)
- SQL Injection and other injection flaws
- Path Traversal
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Mitigations:
- Always validate input against a strict set of rules.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Apply output encoding/escaping to prevent XSS.

---

## WSTG-SEC-01: Security Architecture Testing

Security architecture testing evaluates the overall design and implementation of security mechanisms. This includes reviewing access control policies, authentication mechanisms, authorization levels, and encryption protocols.

### Key Areas:
- Review of authentication and authorization systems
- Access Control Models (RBAC, ABAC)
- Session management architecture
- Encryption and key management practices

### Mitigations:
- Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions.
- Ensure secure session management practices.

---

## WSTG-CRYP-01: Cryptographic Testing

Cryptographic testing assesses the use of cryptographic algorithms in securing sensitive data. It focuses on ensuring that strong encryption techniques are in place for data protection.

### Key Areas:
- Use of strong encryption algorithms (AES, RSA)
- SSL/TLS certificate management and verification
- Proper key management practices
- Data protection both in transit and at rest

### Mitigations:
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Ensure proper key management and lifecycle.
- Use SSL/TLS for securing communication channels.

---

## WSTG-SESN-01: Session Management Testing

Session management testing evaluates how the application handles user sessions, including session fixation, session hijacking, and session expiration.

### Key Areas:
- Secure session handling
- Session timeout and expiration
- Session ID generation and storage
- Prevention of session hijacking

### Mitigations:
- Use secure session management techniques (e.g., generating random session tokens).
- Implement session expiration after a period of inactivity.
- Use secure flags (HttpOnly, Secure) for cookies.

---

## WSTG-INTG-01: Integrity Testing

Integrity testing verifies that data has not been tampered with or modified in unauthorized ways. This includes validating data integrity during storage, transmission, and retrieval.

### Key Areas:
- Data integrity checks (hashes, digital signatures)
- Prevention of unauthorized data modifications
- Prevention of Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks

### Mitigations:
- Use cryptographic techniques like hashing and signing to validate data integrity.
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms for sensitive operations.

---

## WSTG-LOGG-01: Logging and Monitoring Testing

Logging and monitoring are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents. This section focuses on ensuring that the application logs critical security events and that proper monitoring is in place.

### Key Areas:
- Review of logging mechanisms (failed login attempts, sensitive data access)
- Monitoring for unusual activity or suspicious behavior
- Centralized logging and analysis

### Mitigations:
- Ensure that all critical security events are logged.
- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).
- Regularly review logs for signs of malicious activity.

---

## WSTG-VNDS-01: Vendor and Third-Party Testing

Vendor and third-party testing focuses on assessing the security of components that are developed or maintained by external vendors. This includes reviewing security risks related to third-party libraries, services, or components integrated into the application.

### Key Areas:
- Security of third-party libraries and components
- Review of vendor security practices
- Vulnerability management processes

### Mitigations:
- Regularly update third-party components and libraries.
- Ensure third-party vendors follow secure coding and security practices.
- Perform regular vulnerability scans and assessments.
