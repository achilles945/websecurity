# üõ°Ô∏è Web Application Penetration Testing Project  

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently in development. Some features and documentation may be incomplete. ‚ö†Ô∏è**


## Introduction  
This project focuses on conducting a **penetration test** on the **OWASP Juice Shop** web application, following the **OWASP WSTG (Web Security Testing Guide)** methodology as the primary framework. Additionally, the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** are exploited during the testing. <br>
**The repository includes**: <br>
‚úîÔ∏è A structured **pentesting methodology**  
‚úîÔ∏è Automated **testing scripts**  
‚úîÔ∏è Detailed **vulnerability reports**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Proof-of-concept** screenshots  
‚úîÔ∏è **Remediation guides** for security fixes

## Scope  
- **Target:** OWASP Juice-Shop  
- **Testing Approach:** **Black-box**  
- **Vulnerabilities Covered:**  
  - **OWASP Top 10 (2021)**    
- **Testing Environment:** **Local**

## Methodology  
This penetration test follows the **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)** Methodology. The WSTG is a comprehensive guide to testing the security of web applications and web services, it provides a framework of best practices used by penetration testers and organizations <br>

**The methodology consists of**:

1. **Information Gathering**: Collect detailed information about the target to identify potential attack vectors.
2. **Vulnerability Identification (Scanning & Security Testing)**: Identify vulnerabilities within the web application by testing common attack vectors.
3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities (Proof of Concept)**: Test identified vulnerabilities to confirm their exploitability.
4. **AReporting & Remediation**: Document findings, explain the impact of vulnerabilities, and provide remediation steps.

This test leverages the **OWASP WSTG** guidelines for thorough and comprehensive security assessments.

üìñ Detailed methodology can be found in **[docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md)**.

- **Information Gathering:** `Nmap, Nikto, Wget, Shodan`  
- **Vulnerability Identification (Scanning & Security Testing):** `Nikto, ZAP, Burp Suite`  

üìñ Detailed tools information can be found in **[docs/tools.md](docs/tools.md)**.
